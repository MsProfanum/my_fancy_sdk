# my_fancy_sdk

A new Flutter plugin project.

## Prerequisites
To have this project configured properly in Android Studio you have to have the Flutter installed on the machine you're opening the project in (either virtual or stationary).
After cloning the project open the terminal and go to the my_fancy_sdk/example.
Then run the `flutter build apk --config-only` and wait for the configuration to complete.
Then you can open the project in the Android Studio, preferably by opening the example/android/build.gradle.kts file.

## Getting Started with Flutter

Android and/or iOS.
